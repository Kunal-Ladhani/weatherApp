# weatherApp

This is a weather displaying web-app that I made as a personal project, while playing around with Open Weather API. It uses open weather API to fetch data about the weather and displays it, I have implemented geo-location detection. It also shows the weather data for the next 7 days. I made it to practice and implement async-JS and learn more on REST-APIs. Completed it over a weekend.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on netlify - [weatherApp](https://weather-app-kladhani.netlify.app/)
